Run the shortener web server on port 8888 by running:
java -jar webmain.jar

This will create a file named "testdb" in the current directory that's intended to act as a simple persistence for the shortened URLs in case the server goes down.

Multiple servers are currently not supported because we are not using a real database here, just reading and writing to a file without locking. It should be simple to switch in a real database and add the port as an argument if we desire to support this.

All of the source code lies in src/shortener/.
